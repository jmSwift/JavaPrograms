Object Oriented programming
	is the programming paradigm based around objects and a heirarchy of classes. 
	
command -Line argument
	is when the runtime systems passes arguments to the programs main method 
	
gui components
	are objects in which the user interacts via the mouse keyboard or other form of input.Menus that enable the user to effectively perform tasks or certain events in a programming
	
	JFrame, JMenu, JSlider etc
	swing
	
event processing
	the code that responds to the events performed by the user ;
	
java graphics
	the use of JFrame to provide content to the user in a window
	import javax.swing.JFrame;
	
	JDframe window = new JFrame();
	window.setSize(640,480);
	
Lists
	Array of objects: 
		
	
	Linked Lists:
		ArrayList<String> list;
Stacks
	
	
	
Java Collections/ Containers9
	Collection:
	data structure that holds references to other objects
	predefined data structures from the java api
	provide efficient methods that organize store and reterive data without knowing how it was stored, reduces application time
	
	A benefit of Java containers/collections is that an algorithm can be written once, made to work for any type, and retains strong type checking.
	
	Containers:
	
Order of Magnitude concepts as they apply to algorithm
	
Streams (file processing, networking)

Use of Integrated Development Environments(IDEs)
	
	
Designing classes and instantiating them as appropriate

Exception handling
 8uuuure	enables you to create fault tolerant programs that can resolve or handle exceptions and continue executing as if no problems were encountered
	
generics
	List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
	list.add("hello");
	String s = list.get(0);   // no cast
	
	Elimination of casts.
	Enabling programmers to implement generic algorithms.
	
	able types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces and methods.
	
	
Evaluation of Expressions/ Postfix Arithmetic

Stack frames
	

	LinkedList<STRING> list
