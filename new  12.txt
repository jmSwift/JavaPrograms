serialization:

	serialization is the process of saving state of a java object to a sequence of bytes
	
	import java.io.Serializable
		
	public class Student implements Serializable{
		private String studentName;
			
		public String getStudentName(){
		return studentName;
		}
		
		public void setStudent(String currentName)
		this.studentName = currentName;
		}
	}
	
	Student student = new Student();
	student.setStudent("jose Meza");
	
	FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(
	ObjectOutputStream oos
	oos.writeObject(stddeunt)
	fos
	oos.close
	
	

can be sent to a network or stored in a file.

	deserialization is the process of building the object state back from a network from a stored file

commandLINE processing:

	command line processing is when you type a string at the java at runtime and the java compiler does something with it

accessors:
 are methods within a class that return a variable

mutators:
 methods tat change or alter the value of a variable in class
 
inheritatnce:
	is useful for java because it allows you to create a drived class from a pre-existing class. this allows you to add code without modifying the existing code, it also gives you access to the methods of the super class.
	
random;
	Random randy = new Random();
	int dieRoll = ((randy.nextInt(6) + 1) + (randy.nextInt(6) + 1) + (randy.nextInt(6) + 1));
	
evaluation expression/postfix arithmetic
	in postfix form the operator is kept after the operands. EX a+b can be written in AB+ postfix form 
	
stack frames: when we use threading in java various threads are created. the threads are invoked as last in first out form

list array of objects.
	array of objects can be used to store collections of objects so we dont have to declare many different variables
	
Streams(file processing) streams are collections of bytes used to store data which is to be used in input/output

ide:
	used to develop, debug, deploy and maintain softwares easily
